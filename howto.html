      <h2>
        <br />
        This card game is played with 36 cards, consisting of 4 suits and ranks
        ranging from 6 to Ace.
      </h2>
      <p>
        The game can be played by 2, 3, or 4 players. Player 1 will play against
        1, 2, or 3 AI players. Each player starts with 5 cards. To begin, Player
        1 puts a card onto the stack and can add more cards with the same rank.
        The next player can play the first card either with the same suit or the
        same rank and can play more cards with the same rank. Initially, the
        cards on hand must be used, and at least one card must be played. If the
        player does not hold a suitable card, one card must be drawn from the
        blind. This card may be played if it matches the card on the stack, and
        more cards from the player's hand with the same rank can be played
        subsequently. If the drawn card does not match the card on the stack,
        the next player continues. Therefore, no more than one card can be drawn
        from the blind, except when a '6' is placed on the stack. A '6' must
        always be covered by another rank, and if no suitable card is in the
        player's hand, they must draw cards from the blind until the
        '6-must-be-covered rule' is fulfilled. Additionally, other ranks such as
        7, 8, J, and A have special features. (For an explanation, refer to the
        section below titled 'Special Cards').
      </p>

      <p>
        The opaque cards indicate the active player. The "bridge
        monitor" is located in the second row, displaying the last cards played
        with the same rank. The red or blue card below represents the blind. A
        red card indicates that the active player must draw a card. Next to the
        blind is the stack of cards that have already been played. The field
        below shows the possible cards for the next move. Finally, at the
        bottom, the player's hand is displayed, with Player 1 shown
        specifically.

      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Special Cards:</h2>
      <li>
        A '6' in the game must be covered by the same player using a card of a
        different rank, if necessary. The player can achieve this by drawing one
        or more cards from the blind until they have a card that can cover the
        '6'.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a '7' is played, the next player must draw one card from the blind.
      </li>
      <li>
        When an '8' is played, the next player must draw 2 cards and will be
        passed over. If multiple '8's have been played, there are two
        possibilities: Option 1: The next player must draw 2 cards for each '8'
        on the stack and will be passed over. Option 2: The following players
        (not just the next player) must draw 2 cards and will be passed over,
        according to the number of '8's played. Please note that the specific
        rules may vary depending on the variations of the game being played.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a Jack ('J') is played, it can be played to any suit, and the
        player who played the Jack gets to choose which suit must follow. This
        means that the player can designate the desired suit for the next player
        to play.
      </li>
      <li>
        When an Ace ('A') is played, the next player will be passed over. If
        multiple Aces have been played consecutively, the next players (in
        sequential order) will also be passed over. This means that the turn
        will skip those players, and it will continue with the player after the
        last Ace was played.
      </li>
      <br />
      <h3>Special Rule 'Bridge':</h3>
      <p>
        The "Bridge" special rule is as follows: If there are four cards in a
        row on the stack with the same rank, the player who plays the fourth
        card has the option to choose whether or not to finish the current
        round. This means that he can decide whether to continue playing or to
        end the round. In the case of a "Bridge" occurring with four instances
        of the '6' card, the usual rule of the '6 must be covered' does not
        apply. The "Bridge" overrides the '6 must be covered' rule in this
        specific scenario. To keep track of the cards played in sequence with
        the same rank, the "Bridge Monitor" is used. It is located in the second
        row on the table and displays the cards played consecutively with the
        same rank.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Counting:</h2>
      <p>
        Players note their points when one player has no more cards or when a
        "Bridge" is announced. This means that scoring occurs either when a
        player has played all their cards and has none left, or when the player
        who played the fourth card in a row with the same rank chooses to end
        the round by announcing a "Bridge."
      </p>

      <p>The card values are:</p>
      <pre>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Card</th>
            <th>Value</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>0</td>
          </tr>

            <td>7</td>
            <td>0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>9</td>
            <td>0</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>10</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>J</td>
            <td>20 (-20)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Q</td>
            <td>10</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>K</td>
            <td>10</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>A</td>

        </table>
        
      </pre>

      <p>
        For example, if a player's hand consists of these cards with individual
        point values of 10, 15, 10, 0, and 20, the total value of those cards
        would be 55 points. If a round is finished, these points would be added
        to the player's score. The player's score accumulates over multiple
        rounds, reflecting their overall performance in the game.
      </p>
      <img
        src="./images/example_count_points.png"
        height="100px"
        alt="Image Description"
      />
      <br /> <br>
      <h3>Special Counting 'J':</h3>
      <p>If a player finishes a round with a 'J':</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          His score will either be reduced by 20 for each 'J' of his last move,
          or
        </li>
        <li>
          The scores of the other players will be increased by 20 for each 'J'
          of his last move.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The winner of the current round decides which rule will apply.</p>

      <p>If a player reaches exactly 125 points, his score is back on 0!</p>

      <p>
        When the blind is empty and more cards must be drawn, the stack will be
        reshuffled. The points of this round will then be doubled (tripled,
        ...). This also applies to the 'J'-points mentioned before. (An empty
        blind is indicated as card with a grey backside.)
      </p>

      <p>The player with the highest score starts the next round.</p>

      <p>The game is over once a player reaches more than 125 points.</p>

          When a round ends with a 'J' on the stack, a 'J Point-Chooser' is
          shown. It can be clicked or changed using the keyboard 'Down' arrow to
          toggle the decision between adding points for other players or
          subtracting points for the active player.

        <p>
          When 2 or more 8s are played by the same active player, the
          '8-Chooser' will come up. It can be clicked or changed using the
          keyboard 'Down' arrow to toggle the decision between the next player
          drawing 2 cards for each 8 played or the following players drawing 2
          cards.

      <h2>Special Keys (used for testing):</h2>
      <p>
        You can 'influence' the game by dispensing additional cards, finishing a
        round, or making the other players' cards visible.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          v: Toggles the visibility of other players' cards as well as the
          listing of their possible cards for the next move.
        </li>
        <li>f: Finishes the current round.</li>
        <li>
          6, 7, 8, J, Q, K, A: Adds a card with the corresponding rank and a
          random suit to the hand deck of the active player.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        You can follow and review the moves by opening the developer console in
        your browser. For example, press F12 in Google Chrome and select
        'Console'. The output may look like this:
      </p>
